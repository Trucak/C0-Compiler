# C0 Compiler in Haskell

This Haskell project is a compiler for the C0 programming language. It includes modules for lexical analysis (lexer), syntactic analysis (parser), abstract syntax tree (AST) representation, type checking, intermediate code generation, and final code generation.

## Project Structure

- **Lexer**: Contains the lexical analyzer for the C0 language.
- **Parser**: Parses the tokens generated by the lexer into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- **AST**: Defines the abstract syntax tree data structure.
- **Typecheck**: Performs type checking on the AST to ensure type safety.
- **IntermCode**: Generates intermediate code from the AST.
- **FinalCode**: Translates the intermediate code into final executable code.
- **Main.hs**: Entry point of the compiler. Orchestrates the compilation process by integrating the above modules.

## Usage

To use the compiler, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and Cabal installed on your system.

2. Build the project using Cabal:
    ```
    cabal build
    ```

3. Once built, you can use the executable to compile C0 programs. Input your C0 program via standard input (stdin). For example:
    ```
    cabal run < ./examples/example1.c0
    ```

## Compilation Process

The `Main.hs` module orchestrates the compilation process:

1. **Lexical Analysis (Lexer)**: Breaks the input C0 program into tokens.
2. **Syntactic Analysis (Parser)**: Parses the tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
3. **Type Checking**: Ensures type safety of the program.
4. **Intermediate Code Generation**: Converts the AST into intermediate code.
5. **Final Code Generation**: Translates the intermediate code into final executable code.

## Notes

- The type checker may not handle variable assignments with function calls properly, as indicated in the code comments.
